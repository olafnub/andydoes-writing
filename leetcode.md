## Leetcode with accountability & habits
I found myself struggling to stay consistent with leetcode & passing online assessments (OAs). Then one day, 2 friends (Peter & Felicia) asked me if 
I wanted to join them on doing 1 leetcode a day until we got a job. _& that's when everything changed..._ Jk, it wasn't like I got a hired a week later but it did help 
me prepare a lot when it actually came time to interview. **Some ideas to think about:**

1. Create a small group where you and your friends can hold each other accountable for doing leetcode
2. Once you've created the group, go down either [Leetcode 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) or [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice)
3. Everyday have 1 person post "problem of the day." The problem can be solved asynchronously, but by the end of the day, each person in the group should have reacted
to the message, and have also posted their solution to the problem. (Looking at the solution through Neetcode or Leetcode answers is actually advised).
4. Repeat every day until you all get jobs. It's okay to miss 1 day if something came up, but it's not okay to miss 2 days in a row.

For me, I like using discord because they have their "hide / spoil message" feature so anyone can view the answer throughout the day when they're ready to do so. 
Don't memorize each other's solutions if their code is different from yours, focus on understanding why they did it the way they did.

_It's important to just do 1 a day, nothing more, and nothing less; Only 1 leetcode problem a day. If the group is consistent with it after 2 or 3 weeks 
then add 1 more problem to each day. Ex: After 2 weeks, your group can start doing 2 problems a day and on week 4, 3 problems a day. Cap it so it balances out with 
school, life, & etc._

## Resource on how to get better at leetcode

From another reddit post I found (picture below): TL;DR: Spend ~10 minutes on each problem, then look at the solution and try to understand it. The reason why is because 
it's like trying to solve a math problem without knowing the equation. You can add and subtract but if the solution is to multiply, then it's going to take a long time
until you find your solution. Therefore, _it's better to_ understand the solution from the answer key than spending hours trying to solve it. **BUT** everyone learns differently, we're all different, and so this study method will work for some, but will not work for all. But feel free to try it out. Note: With this method, you should record the problem and look back at them later and try solving it without the solution.

## General Advice
General advice and the main advice to be 100% honest is to do leetcode. For big tech / stable tech jobs do leetcode, for startups do projects (though some also ask leetcode). The reason why Leetcode > Projects is because passing the technical is 95% of the work to getting a job.
