### Background
Currently a super-senior @ the university of minnesota, and I wanted to share all my advice and tips for the new generations of CS majors or those still going through.

The idea to share was originally for students studying CS at UMN since I think there's a lot of potential as students are put through the ringer with labs and projects. But we're not getting as much big tech internships compared to other midwest schools. And so I wanted to compile and share my thoughts to help broaden the view of computer science to those reading/watching.

I do want to preface that most my advice will be for students who aren't unsure what their next step is. Everyone has different experience, and many succeed without following the advice that I'm going to give. The reason I want to share my experience is to help those who may feel a bit lost in the CS realm and aren't sure what to do next.
