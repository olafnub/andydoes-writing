### Background
**(A)** Currently a super-senior @ the university of minnesota. I've been wanting to share all my advice and tips for the upcoming generation of CS majors, as well as to those still going through the major.

**(B)** I think there's a lot of potential for CS students @ UMN, as we're put through the ringer with ongoing labs and projects, but I realized we're just not getting as much big tech internships compared to other midwest schools. And so here's a compiled writing of my thoughts to help broaden the view of current computer science majors reading or watching. Of course, this is open for anyone who's willing to read it no matter where you are in the world / background._

**(C)** I do want to preface that most my advice will be for students who aren't unsure what their next step is. Everyone has a different experience, and many succeed without following the advice that I'm going to give. The reason I want to share my experience is to help those who may feel a bit lost in the CS realm and aren't sure what to do next.

### General Advice -- Foundation in chronological order
1. [Learning web development](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (feel free to stop once you can build your own project from scratch)
2. [Take CodePath Technical Interview Prep course (TIP) or watch their youtube advice](https://www.codepath.org/courses/tech-interview-prep) (start looking into #3 after you sign-up)
3. [Getting better at data structures and algorithms (DSA)](https://neetcode.io/practice?subpage=practice) (I would almost overlap this and codepath together. For example I would start neetcoding then then sign up for #2 then continue neetcoding until it's TIP time)

These are seriously the only two things you need for getting into software engineering. **Taking action is when it truly counts**, and if you struggle with consistency, break it down and don't overload yourself. For example, either do 1 neetcode a day or only 1 lesson of the odin project a day. No less, and no more. When you're on a consistent streak of 2-3 weeks and feel like you're ready to up it then you can increase the amount you do.

**Please read paragraph (C), since I believe everyone learns differently.**
